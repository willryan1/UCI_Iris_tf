Uses relu and softmax cross entropy with logits with the gradient descent optimizer.
With a 

Features:
1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 

Prediction target:
Flower type
1. Iris Setosa
2. Iris Versicolour
3. Iris Virginica

Still needs work:
1. commenting
2. variable names
